# Voice-File-Manager
Voice File Manager is a Python program that uses speech recognition and pyautogui to perform file operations like select, copy, paste, and exit through simple voice commands.
By leveraging the speech_recognition and pyautogui libraries, it listens for commands like "select," "copy," "paste," and "exit," then simulates the corresponding keyboard shortcuts. It's a hands-free solution ideal for improving accessibility and convenience during routine file management tasks.
